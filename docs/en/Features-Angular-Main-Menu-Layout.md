Menu and Layout files are located under the shared folder.

Main menu is defined and rendered in the **side-bar.component**. You can add your new menu items here. You generally relate a menu item to an Angular route. Angular routes are defined in several modules:

- app/admin/**admin-routing.module** defines routes for admin module.
- app/main/**main-routing.module** defines routes for main module.
- app/**app-routing.module** defines general routes and the default route.
