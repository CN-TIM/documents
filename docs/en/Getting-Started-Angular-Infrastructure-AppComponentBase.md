# AppComponentBase

If you inherit your components from **AppComponentBase** class, you can
get many commonly used services as pre-injected (like localization,
permission checker, feature checker, ui notify/message, settings and so
on...). For example; you can just use **l(...)** function In views and
**this.l(...)** function in component classes for localization. See
pre-built components for example usages.
