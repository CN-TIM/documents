# Tenant Settings

In a multi-tenant application, tenant settings are shown as below:

<img src="D:/Github/documents/docs/en/images/tenant-settings-core-1.png" alt="Tenant settings" class="img-thumbnail" />

If we disable multi-tenancy, some host settings are also shown in this page (since there is no host setting page). Tenants can also define password complexity settings for their users or they can use password complexity settings defined by host user.

**TenantSettingAppService** is used to get/set tenant settings.
