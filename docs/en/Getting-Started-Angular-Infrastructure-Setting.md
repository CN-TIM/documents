# Setting

You can inject and use SettingService to check settings. It's pre
injected for AppComponentBase (setting field). Settings are defined in
[server side](Development-Guide-Core.md). See setting management [documentation](https://aspnetboilerplate.com/Pages/Documents/Setting-Management) for more.
