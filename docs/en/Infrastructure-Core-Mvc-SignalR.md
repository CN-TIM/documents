# SignalR

SignalR is properly configured and integrated to the startup template. Real time notification and chat systems use it. You can direcly use SignalR in your applications.

Notice that; As the time being, SignalR [has not been released](https://github.com/aspnet/Home/wiki/Roadmap#12) for ASP.NET
Core yet. We integrated **OWIN** to ASP.NET Core pipeline in order to
use SignalR in the application. See [SignalR integration](https://aspnetboilerplate.com/Pages/Documents/SignalR-Integration) document for more information on SignalR.
