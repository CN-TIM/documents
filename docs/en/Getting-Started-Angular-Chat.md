User can add new friends by writing the username into username textbox
above friend list. If "Chat with other tenants" feature is enabled for
tenant, users of other tenants can be added as a friend by writing
\[tenancy name\]\\\[user name\] (ex: Default\\admin). If "Chat with host
users" feature is enabled, host users can be added as friend by writing
.\\\[user name\] in the same textbox.

While online friends/users have a green circle on their profile image,
offline friends/users have a gray circle.

right corner of the chat panel. Application tries to remember last state
