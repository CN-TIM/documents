# Organization Units

Organization units (OU) are used to hierarchically group user and entities. Then you can get user or entities based on their OUs. When we click Administration/Organization units, we enter the related page:

Here, we can manage OUs (create, edit, delete, move) and members (add/remove).

In the left OU tree, we can **right click** to an OU (or left click to **arrow** at the right) to open **context menu** for OU operations. We can also add new members with the upper right button of members area.

This is actually a **generic lookup modal** and can be used to select any type of entity (see app/shared/common/lookup/**common-lookup-modal.component**).
