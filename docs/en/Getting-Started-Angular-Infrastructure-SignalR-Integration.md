# SignalR Integration

SignalR is properly configured and integrated to the startup project.
Real time notification and chat systems use it. You can also direcly use
SignalR in your applications.

Notice that; As the time being, SignalR [has not been
released](https://github.com/aspnet/Home/wiki/Roadmap#12) for ASP.NET
Core yet. We integrated **OWIN** to ASP.NET Core pipeline in order to
use SignalR in the application.

See [SignalR
integration](https://aspnetboilerplate.com/Pages/Documents/SignalR-Integration)
document for more information.
