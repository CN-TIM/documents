# Authorization

You can inject and use PermissionCheckerService to check user
permissions. It's pre injected for AppComponentBase (permission field)
and also you can use shortcut isGranted function. Permissions are
defined in [server side](Development-Guide-Core.md). See authorization
[documentation](https://aspnetboilerplate.com/Pages/Documents/Authorization)
for more.
